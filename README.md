# Excel-Sales-Dashboard

**B&B Sales**<br/>
In this project, we identify trends within the data to provide an overall view of the sales data.  

The following functions utilized are outlined as below:

- PivotTables to identify those trends that are then represented as:
  - Line Chart to represent sales profits by month.
  - Bar Chart to represent sales profits by Salesperson.
  - Pie Charts to represent sales percentages by product category and city.
  - A dashboard in Microsoft Excel containing all charts and tables.
